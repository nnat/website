    <h2 class="text-center mbm">Why we are building RiseBox</h2>
    <p class="mbm">We love the city : it's' energy efficient, energizing, innovative, but providing everyone here with healthy, tasty, sustainable food is a hard problem.</p>
    <p class="mbm">So we thought what if people could grow their own food at home ?</p>
    <p class="mbl">Of course we have too little space, we are not farmers, and live busy lives, but if we could address those issues, it could have a significant impact on the quality of our lives while providing a more sustainable, local and resilient model.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-center">We designed RiseBox to make it possible</h3>
    <p class="mbm">It creates an organic food producing ecosystem in your home or appartment, and uses technology to adapt to your environment and your lifestyle.</p>
    <p>So RiseBox essentially runs itself, uses very little energy and water, is very productive, and makes growing your own healthy food fun and educative.</p>
    <p class="mbm">We believe change is not started by organisations and policies, but by people like you and us, sharing a vision of a more sensible future, and acting to make it happen.</p>
    <p class="mbl">We wish to empower you to start the growing revolution.</p>
